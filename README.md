# Computer Security Project

## Running the Client Application

To run the Client, cd into the client folder and run the following command:

```command
npm start
```

This should open a localhost application, but if not, a link to the application should appear in the console after the above command has executed.

## Running the Server Application

To run the Server, simply cd into the server folder and run the following command:

```command
npm start
```

Note that you will need to plug in the physical RFID scanner device to use the server.
